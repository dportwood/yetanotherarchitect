Even at the same cost, moving from Proofpoint + MSP/RMM + multiple point tools to Microsoft 365 (F3/E5) + Defender for Endpoint P2 is better because you’re not just buying features—you’re buying system-level outcomes: fewer handoffs, fewer seams, and a single operating model across security, endpoint management, and service delivery.

Value advantage statement (detailed)

At the same price point, consolidating onto Microsoft 365 (F3/E5) with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 creates value by turning a collection of tools into a cohesive operating platform. You gain one identity-driven control plane, one telemetry backbone, and one governance model that supports standardized ITSM, change control, and enterprise architecture—reducing risk and operating friction created by multiple providers, overlapping agents, and disconnected workflows. The result is faster incident resolution, cleaner audits, more predictable change outcomes, and lower “hidden” labor cost, even when licensing spend is flat.

Why it’s better even if cost is equal

1) Fewer seams = fewer failures

Multi-vendor stacks fail at the boundaries: email → identity → endpoint → SaaS.

A unified Microsoft stack reduces “integration debt” (connectors, API breaks, version drift, alert duplication, missed correlations) and the operational risk that comes with it.

2) A single security narrative and response path

With disparate systems, you manage alerts. With a unified stack, you manage incidents end-to-end.

MDE P2 plus Microsoft 365 security signals enable consistent triage, investigation, and containment workflows—fewer swivel-chair steps and less ambiguity about “who owns what.”

3) Governance and change control become enforceable, not aspirational

When controls span multiple providers, change control becomes negotiation and documentation-heavy (and often inconsistent).

With one platform, you can standardize:

Policy-as-configuration (baseline security settings, device compliance, access requirements)

Controlled rollouts (pilot rings, staged deployment, rollback patterns)

Measurable outcomes (compliance posture, exposure score, patch and configuration drift)

4) Enterprise architecture benefits: standard patterns, fewer exceptions

A single platform enables repeatable reference architectures for:

Identity and access patterns (join types, conditional access patterns, privileged access)

Endpoint baselines and compliance models

Security logging/retention strategy and incident workflows

Fewer exceptions = lower long-term cost and fewer “one-off” support scenarios.

5) ITSM integration gets simpler and more reliable

In multi-platform environments, ITSM is glued together via connectors and custom mappings that degrade over time.

With a unified provider and standardized data models, you can better align:

Incident creation/routing and enrichment

Asset/inventory accuracy

Change impact analysis (what devices/users/apps are affected)

Problem management trends (repeat offender detection with consistent taxonomy)

6) Less vendor management overhead

Same license dollars, but fewer hidden costs:

Fewer renewals, vendor security reviews, DPAs, procurement cycles

Fewer support contracts and escalations

Clearer accountability (one throat to choke when things break)

7) Reduced operational complexity on endpoints

Multiple agents and overlapping controls increase performance impact and create policy collisions.

Consolidation reduces endpoint overhead and improves reliability (fewer drivers/services, fewer update channels, fewer false positives created by tool interactions).

8) More predictable security and support maturity

MSP/RMM stacks often vary by technician workflow and tool sprawl.

A unified Microsoft-first model supports standardized operating procedures, training, and measurable maturity progression (repeatable runbooks, consistent reporting, common role definitions).

Short “board-ready” closer

Even at equal cost, consolidation wins because it reduces risk and friction: one platform means one control plane, one data story, one governance model, and one accountable provider—which improves security outcomes and operational reliability while lowering the hidden labor cost of tool sprawl.
